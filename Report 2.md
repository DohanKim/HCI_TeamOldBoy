### Studio Reflections

#### I Like...
- first solution because reflects real situation.
- third solution because traveler could find their travel mate in travel! (Not before the trip)
- focus your user to a single traveler

#### I wish...
- slightly modify your POV's wording or solution. Your app looks like a dataing app, not a travel app.

#### What if...
- think considerately about how you arrange traveler's actual time and place
- focus on security issue(prevent strange user) for female traveler

#### Reflections
- contents

### More Needfinding (Updates in DP1)

We did interview again and get few more insights.

**New Interviewee #1** (interviewer: ALL)
>**Descriptions:** 23 years old, Female, University student, from Daejeon, exchage student in Italy, Traveled Europe alone for about 2 months.
>
>**Observations** : We assume that she will be in London in 3 days and see how she acts in online. 

#### new insight:

- Female prefer Male as well
(Our previous insight was female prefer both gender)
- how to filter strange person(normally man) will be our challenge issue
- After traveler send message to their travel mate candidate, they may wait unitl 3~4 hours. After that they could consider that request is finished
( we should think about how can we make user reply fast / in time)
- Profile picture is very important in choose travel mate in online
- We can develop some ideas about make events with Korean domitory(한인민박)
