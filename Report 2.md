### Studio Reflections

#### I Like...
- first solution because reflects real situation.
- third solution because traveler could find their travel mate in travel! (Not before the trip)
- focus your user to a single traveler


#### I wish...
- slightly modify your POV's wording or solution. Your app looks like a dataing app, not a travel app.



#### What if...
- think considerately about how you arrange traveler's actual time and place
- focus on security issue(prevent strange user) for female traveler

#### Reflections
