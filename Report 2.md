Giwan was moving from Paris to London by train. In the train, he was trying to find someone to watch the musical 'Lion King' together. By using our service, he found the chat room for watching the musical in London. When he joined the chat room, people in there already had an appointment, therefore he asked them if he could join. Finally Giwan watched the musical with people happily.

Therefore she looked through the photo timeline to see who took photos near her just now. After finding a picture taken by a handsome guy near the Eiffel Tower few minutes ago, she sent a message to him. Finally, Soohee had a good time at the Eiffel Tower with him.

### Studio Reflections

#### I Like
- First solution because I(the speaker) experienced the needs a lot in real situation.
- Third solution because traveler could find travel mate immediately when they want. 
- Your team focusing on single travelers as the target user 

#### I Wish
- Your team slightly modify the POV's wording or solution. It seems like a dating app, not a travel app.

#### What If
- Your team consider security issues of photo timeline 

#### Reflections
- (About the ‘I wish’ item) What we found out and surprised about was people actually finding their travel mates as they are finding date partners. So it is intended if our service looks like a dating app. 
- (About the ‘What If’ item) We will consider the security issues on further design process. We are thingking about probable issues and solutions.

### More Needfinding (Updates in DP1)

We interviewed one more person to catch for insights from female user.

**New Interviewee #1** (interviewer: Dohan, Giwan, Jaegyun, Eunseok)

#### Personal Information
She is 23 years old university student living in Daejeon. She was in Italy as an exchange student and has traveled Europe alone for about 2 months.

#### Interview Process
- Tried to set Master-Apprentice relationship
- Let her assume that she will travel London in two days and ‘do what she usually do’.
- Used withdrawal and return scheme
- Asked if she had any difficulty when she was finding a travel mate

#### Insights
- Female prefer male as well (We expected that female would not have gender preferences)
- Users need a method to avoid suspicious people
- Pictures are very important information to choose travel mates
