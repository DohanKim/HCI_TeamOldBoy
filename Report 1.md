### Experience
**Finding a travel-mate.**

----------
### Before the interviews
Before conducting real interviews, we tried to look around real activities happening to find travel mates.

##### References
 - Naver cafe "유랑" (community of backpackers traveling the Europe)
 - Facebook group "유럽 어디까지 가봤니?" (a.k.a. 유디니) (community of backpackers traveling the Europe)
 - Mobile aplication "설레여행" (finds travelmates)

##### We were noticed that
 - Most of the users finding travel mates from web forums or mobile applications are in their 20s or 30s.
 - Users can be divided into two groups of finding travel mates today and finding travel mates for few months later.
 - Users sometimes describe their personal characters in many aspects such as travel style, food preference, and even photographic skills not only the itinerary.

----------
### Observations & Interviews

#### Interviews
- Tried to set Master-Apprentice relationship with our interviewees
- Let interviewees assume that they will travel to somewhere they want and ‘do what they usually do’.
- Used withdrawal and return scheme
- Asked what difficulties interviewees had in finding travel mates in the past

**Interviewee #1** (interviewer: Eunseok)

Interesting Moments

- She searched facebook page with city name and kept scrolling down even though the search results was not that useful.
- She spent long time to check candidates’ personal information looking Facebook posts or Kakaotalk profile.
- She felt uncomfortable if the candidates set their information private.

**Interviewee #2** (interviewer: Dohan)
>**Descriptions:** 25 years old, male, university student. He is from ..., and traveled Europe alone for 70 days.

He used "유랑" when he travle Europle. In the inverview, he is in the Belgium and go to Rome, and need to find travel-mate for Rome trip. First, he go in to the "유디니", and search the hashtag "Rome travel-mate(로마동행)". He kept pressing see more buttons, and scrolling. However, most of the posts shows about past trip, so he went to "유랑". He searched city name and read through the title of posts to find right date. When there was proper title, he clicked, and checked the content fast. If he could know that the candidate was man, he immediately abandoned it, and checked another post. When he found the perfect candidate, first he check whether the KakaoTalk ID is available. If not, he uses Naver Note service. He spent some time to write the rich note to candidate. He explained this effort make me more valuable person to be chosen.

Interesting Moments

- He kept scrolling "유디니" Facebook group, when he has no specific purpose and even when the search results are not fit to his needs.
![eudini](http://dl.dropbox.com/s/pvemj0ync5nd8ad/Eudini.png)
- He prefer cauchsurfing where he can get free accomodations to travel-mates. When he got travel-mate in "유랑", the relationship between him and mate is almost business relationship. From this relationship, he felt frustrated, so he prefer couchsurfing that have more familiar communication with house-owner than just travel-mates.
- Also, he prefer "유디니" than "유랑" because he can know about the candidate's characteristics visiting his/her Facebook profile. In the contrast, most of posts in "유랑" has no personal information.

**Interviewee #3** (interviewer: Jakyun, Giwan)
>**Descriptions:** 27 years old,  robust male, university student. He is from Seoul. 

He is an extreme user that have already known the url of "유랑" naver cafe. In his upcoming travel, he want to find people to travel with him in London during 5 days. First of all, he try to find a fellow traveler and then plan a journey concerning the plan of the traveler. Even, he don't have to visit a landmark if the fellow traveler don't want to visit it.
  Now, he visited "유랑".  He searched "London" in "유랑 동행" board. Then, he clicked the links of search result messages whose itinerary period overlaps his travel period in London, pressing command-key for opening a different tab in Chrome. That's the way for him to memorize the messages.
  Until, no more available messages left, he checked all related messages and contacted them.

Interesting Moments
- He did not look at messages written by guys. For example, there was a message written by "guyguy" user. He made certain that the message was written by a male. In some case, even though a travel period of a message a female wrote didn't overlap his period, he tried to click the link without recognizing the period. And some minutes passed by then, he realized it.
![to_female](http://dl.dropbox.com/s/616p58m1yr5eqkm/tofemale.jpg)
- If he found a female user, he prefer sending Kakao Talk messages or private messages to leaving a public comment. Because he don't want to have an image unworthy of a gentleman to other users.(신사답지 못한 이미지를 갖고 싶지 않기 때문이다.)
- There is no sign that it has been opened so that he also clicked some links that have already opened.

### Needs
#### The users want to find a travel-mate who
1. visits the same city
2. has the same itinerary
3. is credible or safe
4. has similar personal character with me
5. has similar preference for food
6. has similar budget constraint
7. has the same style of traveling like visiting museum, art gallary, or landmarks.
8. has the similar volume of schedule
9. can share a accommodation
10. is good at taking photo

----------
### Insights
1. Finders starts serching with city names first, and compares date that candidates stay in the city. In this observation, The city name and date are the important metrics to narrow down their choice.
2. Finders want many good aspect from travel-mates. It seems like they want disposible friend, not just bodyguard or person with itinerary. Probably, they want emotional connection with travle-mates.
3. When the users find travel-mates of tonight, they take care about the date and location only. However, when they find travel-mates for trip in a couple of months later, they starts consider many things.
4. Some interviewees talked about the sudden disconnection with travel-mate candidate. However, they added when they communicate with Facebook, it is less likely to occur the sudden disconnection than anonymous KakaoTalk. When people are anonymous, they make disconnection more easily.
5. Female interviewees showed the action that checks whether the candidates are credible or not. For example, checking the KakaoTalk profile or checking the Facebook account. At this point female finders want to know about candidate's credibility.
6. In the credibility checking, more personal information makes more credible. It can be checked with blog articles, Facebook posts, concrete explanations, etc.
7. Basically, "유랑", and "유디니" is Korean community. Also, if the interviewee had the chance to get foreign travel-mates in hostel, they said they avoided getting foreign traveler. These situations are caused by language barrier between Korean and English.
8. In community observation, some posts had more replies than other posts. Most of them are female's posts, but the replies are mixed. It means female is more popular than male in candidate pool.
9. In community observation, most of the cities are popular city. There are common cities to travel with travel-mates.
10. There are some critical factor that makes users decide travel-mate for each other. Although, the candidate has obvious disadvantages, when the candidate has suggestion to do the special activity, like watching musical, and the user loves musical, he decides the candidate as travel-mate.

### Studion Reflections
#### I Like...
- Your determination that change the topic.
- Your process that tries to find good target user.

#### I wish...
- You concern more about the human factor. In my experience, big human pool is critical factor in this problem.
- You concern about the extreme users.

#### What if...
- Expand the user population to various ages.
- The old agers are tend to use package tour like "하나투어", "모두투어", think about it.

#### Reflections
In studio feedback, there are several statements about the extreme users. In this reason, we think about the extreme users in our topic, finding travel-mates. We conclude that our extreme user can be determined by travel frequency or financial budget. With this matircs, we need more interview or survey, and then we will be able to understand about our extreme users.
